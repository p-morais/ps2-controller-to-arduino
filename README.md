# ps2-controller-to-arduino

Some code that allows you to interface over serial with the microcontroller onboard a sony ps2 controller, using an arduino. I wrote this as part of a hacked together budget rf controller, but thought other people might find it useful.

See [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20171115162017/http://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/PS2/) for some in depth explanation of the packet structure, and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus) if you're new to SPI.
